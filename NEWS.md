v0.2.2
------

Bug-fix release for `v0.2.1`. It does not change the API in any way,
but interpolates the first argument as well as the second (thank you
[nh2](https://github.com/nh2)).  So, the first argument does not need
to be a `String` anymore.

v0.2.1
------

Bug-fix release for `v0.2.0`.  It does not change the API in any way,
but adds a few more tests and some more documentation.
